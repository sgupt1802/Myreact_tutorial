## Learning Goals

-  Learn about React components and props.
-  Understand state management in React.
-  Explore React Router for navigation.
<!-- - [ ] Integrate external APIs with React.
- [ ] Experiment with stateful and stateless functional components. -->

## Resources

Here are some resources I've found helpful in my learning journey:

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)
- [W3Schools-React Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP)


## Progress

- **Day 1:** Started with the basics-: learnt about the basic tree structure of react and how the react-scripts help injecting the main HTML into JS. 

- **Day 2:** Learnt about the Hooks in react. I learnt that they are useful to hook into some features like state (eg: useState). Made the simple counter project

- **Day 3:** Learnt about the Virtual DOM, Reconcillation and React Fibre. Read some articles from documentation and Github
    - [React Fibre Theory-Github](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)

- **Day 4:** Learnt about the props. In simple words they are the information that you pass to a JSX tag in your components. Made the Background changer project

- **Day 5:**  Practiced React by making the Password Generator project and also gained little idea about useEffect, useCallback, useRef(for copying the passsword) hooks of react. useCallback is used to cache a function based on the dependency array.

- **Day 6:** Learnt about how we can make our own custom hooks and started with the currencyConverter project. Made the InputBox component

- **Day 7:** Made the final App.jsx for the currencyConverter project. Learnt about the useId hook of react and about the parameter passing in components function. currencyConverter project finished.

- **After few weeks:**: Finally started the basics of the REDUX.
## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sgupt1802/Myreact_tutorial.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd` *project name*
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` and `tailwind` dependencies if you find the tailwind.config.js in the project.
You can use this [Link](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for the tailwind injection in your project through terminal.
4. Run the project: `npm run dev` or go to the package.json file to check the scripts to run.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!


**Happy coding!**
